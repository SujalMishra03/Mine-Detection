# Mine-Detection
## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to classify sonar signals as either rock ('R') or mine ('M'). The dataset used is the SONAR dataset, which consists of 60 numerical features extracted from sonar signals. The model is trained using scikit-learn and evaluates its accuracy on both training and test data.

## Dataset

The dataset used is SONAR.csv, which contains 208 samples with 60 feature columns and 1 label column.
R represents rock.
M represents mine.
